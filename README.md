Robot Code &amp; Resources for PantherTech's 2025 season.

# Resources

### Things we might want to try this season & Goals

- Elastic Dashboard - https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/elastic-2025-a-lot-of-little-things/472475
- Robot Alerts - Either elastic or the new ones in WPILib
- Logging - https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/robot-telemetry-with-annotations.html
- Use new WPILib LED Code (No more coding lights for hours!) - https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/hardware-apis/misc/addressable-leds.html#led-patterns
- Object Detection? (LimeLight 4)
- Perhaps try Choreo? It factors in robot properites like weight, so you can get the most optiomal speeds. Also can directly supply paths to PathPlannerLib, no code changes needed.
